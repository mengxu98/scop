\arguments{
\item{srt}{Seurat object}

\item{features}{A character vector; giving feature names.}

\item{n}{An integer; number of results to return.}

\item{features_use}{A character vector; list of features eligible to be returned.}

\item{anticorr}{A logical value indicating whether to allow negatively correlated genes.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{aggregator}{How to combine correlations when finding similar features.
Options: "sum" (default), "min" (for "and"-like filter), "max", or "mean".}

\value{
character vector.

\description{
Given a Seurat object and a list of feature names,
this function returns features that are strongly correlated with those markers.
