Default is \url{https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda}.}

\item{envname}{The name of a conda environment.}

\item{version}{A character vector specifying the version of the environment.
Default is \code{"3.10-1"}.}

\item{force}{Whether to force a new environment to be created.
If \code{TRUE}, the existing environment will be recreated.

\description{
Prepare the virtual environment by installing the required dependencies and setting up the environment.
This function prepares the virtual environment by checking if conda is installed,
creating a new conda environment if needed, installing the required packages,
and setting up the Python environment for use with scop.
In order to create the environment, this function requires the path to the conda binary.
If \code{conda} is set to \code{"auto"}, it will attempt to automatically find the conda binary.
If a conda environment with the specified name already exists and \code{force} is set to \code{FALSE},
the function will use the existing environment.
If \code{force} set to \code{TRUE}, the existing environment will be recreated.
Note that recreating the environment will remove any existing data in the environment.
The function also checks if the package versions in the environment meet the requirements specified by the \code{version} parameter.
