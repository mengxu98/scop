\arguments{
\item{srt_list}{A list of \code{Seurat} objects to be checked and preprocessed.}

\item{batch}{A character string specifying the batch variable name.}

\item{assay}{The name of the assay to be used for downstream analysis.}

\item{do_normalization}{A logical value indicating whether data normalization should be performed.}

\item{normalization_method}{The normalization method to be used.
Possible values are \code{"LogNormalize"}, \code{"SCT"}, and \code{"TFIDF"}.
Default is \code{"LogNormalize"}.}

\item{do_HVF_finding}{A logical value indicating whether highly variable feature (HVF) finding should be performed.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{HVF_source}{The source of highly variable features.
Possible values are \code{"global"} and \code{"separate"}.
Default is \code{"separate"}.}

\item{HVF_method}{The method for selecting highly variable features.
Default is \code{"vst"}.}

\item{nHVF}{The number of highly variable features to select.
Default is \code{2000}.}

\item{HVF_min_intersection}{The feature needs to be present in batches for a minimum number of times in order to be considered as highly variable.
The default value is \code{1}.}

\item{HVF}{A vector of highly variable features.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{vars_to_regress}{A vector of variable names to include as additional regression variables.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{seed}{An integer specifying the random seed for reproducibility.
Default is \code{11}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the preprocessed \code{Seurat} objects,
the highly variable features, the assay name,
and the type of assay.
}
\description{
This function checks and preprocesses a list of \code{Seurat} objects.
It performs various checks on the input, including verification of input types,
assay type consistency, feature name consistency, and batch column consistency.
It also performs data normalization and variable feature finding based on the specified parameters.
Finally, it prepares the data for integration analysis based on the highly variable features.
